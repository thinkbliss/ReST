                        <h2>Noting Practice</h2>
                        <p>Despite popular belief in the power of positive thinking, learning how to handle negative thoughts has a much greater impact on well-being and success than positive thinking. In fact, repeating affirmations that you don’t really believe can actually make you feel worse by highlighting the gap between what you’re telling yourself and how you truly feel.1 Similarly, attempting to suppress or deny negative thoughts makes them stronger and more persistent.<sup>2,5</sup> Noting practice neutralizes the power of negative thoughts by helping us to disengage, and to view our thoughts from a greater distance, which may allow us to recognize that not everything we think is inherently true. Naming our thoughts and feelings in the midst of a stress response actively engages the prefrontal cortex, which helps us quickly transition out of the amygdala “fight or flight” mode to a more balanced response.<sup>3</sup> Noting practice has been shown to decrease stress, anxiety, depression and insecurity.<sup>1,2,3,5</sup></p><br/>
