                        <h2>Improve Your Sleep</h2>
                        <p>Getting 7-9 hours of restful sleep may be the single most important thing you can do for your physical and emotional health, and cognitive performance.<sup>1,2</sup> After only one night of sleep loss, we experience a 30% loss of cognitive ability, and after 5 nights in a row of only 6 hours of sleep, we experience a 60% drop in cognitive functioning.<sup>2</sup> Poor sleep contributes to a number of chronic health conditions, and we now know that it is not only a symptom of mental health disorders, but also a cause of them. One longitudinal study found that people who had a history of insomnia were 4 times more like to develop depression over the next 3 years, compared to normal sleepers.<sup>6</sup> Sleep also helps us recuperate from stressful or traumatic experiences. A study that followed repatriated prisoners of war found that sleep was the strongest predictor of mental resilience.<sup>4</sup></p><br/>
                        <p>
                        There is still much to learn about the precise function of sleep, but we do know that there are 5 stages of sleep, lasting 60-110 minutes each, that we need to cycle through several times a night for optimal health and performance.<sup>4</sup> The first 4 stages are “quiet,” increasingly deep sleep, the last of which produces physiological changes that help boost immune system functioning. From this stage we progress into REM sleep, where dreaming occurs. REM sleep enhances learning and memory, and contributes to emotional health. Interruptions to the cycle cause us to start over, and can prevent us from getting to the stages of sleep where we replenish our cognitive and emotional resources. If you are one of the 30% of Americans who are sleep-deprived, consider trying one or more of the strategies to improve your sleep.</p><br/>
