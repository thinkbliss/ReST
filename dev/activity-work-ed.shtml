Most of us attempt to suppress our nerves and try to calm down when we’re feeling anxious, but this may actually make things worse. Embracing and harnessing our stress response significantly improves performance, boosts confidence, and reduces the negative impact of stress on health.1,2, 3 </p>

                        <p>There is intriguing new research that suggests that it is not the experience of stress that is harmful to our health, but rather the belief stress is harmful!<sup>1,2</sup> Kelly McGonigal gives an entertaining summary of this research in her TED Talk, “How to Make Stress Your Friend.” How we evaluate stress also has a tremendous impact on our ability to perform our best. When we are feeling anxious, most of us try to suppress our nerves and try to calm down, but this is often difficult to achieve and may be counterproductive. One study showed that reappraising nervousness as excitement significantly improved performance across a variety of settings. This works because the physiological signs of anxiety and excitement are very similar, so it is an easy mental leap to the more positive interpretation of excitement. Calm is the physiological opposite of anxiety, so it requires greater effort to shift from one to the other.<sup>3</sup> In another study, the simple act of reading a paragraph suggesting that stress might help test performance, led to significantly higher GRE scores.<sup>4</sup> By believing stress is good for us, or reinterpreting it as excitement, we free our mental energy from self-monitoring and worry, to fully engage in the challenge at hand.
