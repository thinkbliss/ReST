                            <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Thrive we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
                            <ul class="simplelist">
                                <li>We do not ask you for personal information that we don’t truly need. (e.g. gender, age, income level)</li>
                                <li>We will not share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
                                <li>We do not store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
                                <li>The information you enter in your personal account is kept private, and cannot be seen by search engines.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Thrive: growing wellness operates www.growingwellness.life and www.thrivetools.life. It is Thrive's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
                            <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
                            <p>Like most website operators, Thrive collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Thrive's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Thrive’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Thrive may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                            <p>Certain visitors to Thrive 's websites choose to interact with Thrive in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Thrive gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, Thrive collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Thrive. Thrive does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always decline to supply personally-identifying information, with the understanding that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
                            <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
                            <p>Thrive may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Thrive may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Thrive does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
                            <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                            <p>Thrive discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (1) need to know that information in order to process it on Thrive’s behalf or to provide services available at Thrive’s websites, and (2) have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Thrive’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</p>
                            <p>Thrive will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Thrive discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Thrive believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Thrive, third parties or the public at large.</p>
                            <p>If you are a registered user of a Thrive website and have supplied your email address, Thrive may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Thrive and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it, without identifying information, in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Thrive takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
                            <h2>Cookies</h2>
                            <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Thrive uses cookies to help Thrive identify and track visitors, their usage of Thrive website, and their website access preferences. Thrive visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Thrive’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Thrive’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
                            <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
                            <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Thrive may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Thrive’s sole discretion. Thrive encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
