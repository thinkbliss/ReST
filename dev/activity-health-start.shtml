                                	<li>Improving physical health. In the short term, adequate sleep reduces cravings for food and substances, strengthens the immune system, and accelerates recovery from injury and illness. Over time it reduces risk for a number of chronic diseases.</li>

                                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                                <p>Please choose one or two of the sleep strategies below that you don’t already do, and try it for a full week. Pay attention to the impact it has on your sleep and how you feel.</p>
                                <ul>
                                	<li>Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep a night. If this is too big a jump up from how much sleep you get now, start by going to bed half an hour earlier than usual.</li>
                                	<li>Try out a sleep app http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/30/best-sleep-apps_n_3691693.html.</li>
                                	<li>Develop a sleep routine: try to go to bed and get up at approximately the same time each day, even on weekends, and go through the same ritual each night, for example: brush teeth, get into pajamas, and read for 15 minutes.</li>
                                	<li>Unwind. If racing thoughts keep you up, try practicing a “mind dump” each night by jotting down your worries and unfinished tasks before going to bed. Alternatively, find an activity that absorbs your attention and helps you relax, such as reading, crossword puzzles, meditation, or journaling.</li>
                                	<li>Avoid stimulants (caffeine, cigarettes, vigorous exercise, bright light) for a few hours before bed. Caffeine has a 5-hour half-life, and takes about a day to fully clear your system.</li>
                                	<li>Nap: If you get tired in the afternoons, try to take a 20 to 30-minute nap, but make sure it’s not too late in the day, or it may disrupt your sleep.</li>
                                </ul>
