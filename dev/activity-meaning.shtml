                        <h2>Think Big</h2>
                        <p>A common response to feeling down or overwhelmed is to turn inward, withdraw, and try to conserve our energy. When our emotional resources are depleted it can feel counterintuitive to turn our attention outward, yet doing so helps to buffer against stress and depression, lift mood and restore energy.<sup>3,4</sup> Broadening our perspective is also helpful in high stakes situations such as job interviews, exams, or public speaking.</p><br/>
                        <p>
                        By focusing on a bigger-than-self goal, value, or purpose, we shift our attention away from concerns about making a good impression, or what other people are thinking of us. Investment in “image-management” has been shown to contribute to higher levels of anxiety, depression, competitiveness, confusion, self-consciousness, isolation, and self-criticism.<sup>1</sup> Alternatively, a more compassionate or value-driven approach is correlated with decreased depression and anxiety, feeling more peaceful, engaged, loving and cooperative. When we come from this broader perspective, we also make stronger connections, gain greater personal and professional support, and are more successful at achieving our goals.<sup>1</sup></p><br/>
                        <p>
                        Whenever you find yourself becoming overly concerned about what others think of you, or feel the need to make a good impression, try widening your perspective by reflecting on a larger purpose. You might be surprised at the impact this has on the ease and quality of your interactions.
